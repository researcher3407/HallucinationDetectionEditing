These agreements allow our customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods. Therefore, changes in Customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, and are renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Our management reviews our Customer support renewal rates on a quarterly basis and we use these rates as a method of monitoring our customer service performance.

Overall, the gross margin percentage on Customer support revenues increased to approximately 90% from approximately 89%.For illustrative purposes only, had we accounted for revenues under proforma Topic 605, customer support revenues would have been $1,246.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, which would have been higher by approximately $13.8 million or 1.1% as compared to the prior fiscal year; and would have been up 3.0% after factoring the impact of $23.3 million of foreign exchange rate changes.

However, the tax rate may fluctuate if business changes are implemented in response to legislation arising from the OECD’s Base Erosion & Profit Shifting Project. Legislative change in key territories is being monitored and acted upon.The Group does not anticipate any significant impact on the future tax charge, liabilities or assets, as a result of the triggering of Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, but cannot rule out the possibility that, for example, a failure to reach satisfactory arrangements for the UK’s future relationship with the European Union, could have an impact on such matters.The European Commission has concluded its investigation into the UK’s controlled foreign company (“CFC”) rules. The CFC rules levy a charge on foreign entities controlled by the UK that are subject to a lower rate of tax, however there is currently an exemption available for 75% of this charge if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing. The EC concluded that this exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules. However, whilst we are awaiting further detail from HMRC, the position has not changed from a tax accounting perspective. The risk is possible, but not probable. UK ministers have yet to decide on whether to pursue an appeal. No provision for this potential liability of $3.6M has been provided in these Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not clear what, if any, the ultimate financial result will be.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following:As at 31 March 2019 the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have been recognised was $Nil (2018: $Nil). No liability has been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the reversal of temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

We continued augmenting our existing LTE network with 4.5G technology investments that are also 5G-ready to prepare for the commercial launch of 5G in select markets in early 2020. In 2019, we acquired spectrum licences for $1,731 million, which is not included in the table above. See “Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources”.CABLE The decrease in capital expenditures in Cable this year was a result of lower purchases of customer premise equipment and lower investments related to the initial launch of Ignite TV.

These upgrades will lower the number of homes passed per node and incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an even more reliable customer experience as we progress in our Connected Home roadmap.MEDIA The increase in capital expenditures this year was a result of higher investments in renovations at various Toronto Blue Jays facilities, partially offset by lower investment in our broadcast and IT infrastructure and the sale of our publishing business.CORPORATE The increase in Corporate capital expenditures this year was a result of higher investments in IT and our various real estate facilities this year, including the impact of $25 million of proceeds from the sale of certain assets last year.CAPITAL INTENSITY Capital intensity this year was in line with 2018.

The AASB equivalent of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contract with Customers replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer – either over time or at a point in time – depending on when performance obligations are satisfied.The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using the modified retrospective approach with changes reflected in opening retained profits. The application of the standard did not result in a significant change to the recognition of revenue compared to the previous accounting policy for revenue.Altium has one performance obligation for each of the revenue streams listed below and has applied the following revenue recognition methods:1. Software licenses: Revenue is recognised at a point in time when license activation is available to the user. 2. Subscription and maintenance: Revenue is deferred and is subsequently recognised over the period in which the subscription service is provided. As the billing structure for customers is often bundled with licenses and billed on activation, there is an allocation methodology applied based on stand-alone selling prices to calculate the portion of revenue to be deferred. 3. Search advertising: Revenue is recognised at a point in time on a price-per-click basis, this is when a user engages with the search result on the website by clicking on it. 4. Services revenue: Revenue from providing services is recognised over the period in which the services are rendered. Services include training and implementation services. 5. Other revenue - Royalties: Royalties related to IP are recognised at a point in time when the subsequent sales occurs. 6. Interest income: Revenue is recognised on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the assets net carrying amount.Impact on opening retained profitsFor incremental costs incurred in obtaining a contract, such as sales commissions, Altium has chosen to apply the practical expedient available under the standard which permits immediate expensing when the underlying asset is amortised in one year or less, given subscription periods are typically for a 12 month period.Where revenue is deferred for more than 12 months and an upfront commission has been paid, the commission is capitalised and amortised over the period the revenue is recognised. Altium had US$6 million in long-term deferred revenue as at 30 June 2018 which resulted in an adjustment of US$0.3 million to opening retained profits on adoption of the standard.Altium had US$6.9 million in long-term deferred revenue as at June 2019 which resulted in an adjustment of US$ 0.2 million to capitalise commissions.Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptionsRevenue for multiple element contracts is allocated based on stand-alone selling prices and then recognised revenue according to the accounting policy for each revenue stream.

Text: To calculate the percentage change in net income from 2018 to 2019, we first need to find the net income for 2018 and 2019.

- Net Income in 2018: $2,380,681
- Net Income in 2019: $2,191,430

Next, we use the formula for percentage change:

Percentage Change = ((Net Income in 2019 - Net Income in 2018) / Net Income in 2018) * 100

Percentage Change = (($2,191,430 - $2,380,681) / $2,380,681) * 100
Percentage Change = (-$189,251 / $2,380,681) * 100
Percentage Change ≈ -7.95%

Therefore, the percentage change in net income from 2018 to 2019 is approximately -7.95%, indicating a decrease in net income."

Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does  may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, our net income and our other GAAP financial results.

This obligation is due under an operating lease from our acquisition of Atmel for a building in San Jose, California.(2) Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or purchases of property, plant and equipment. These obligations were not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2019, as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.(3) Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and outstanding purchase commitments with our wafer foundries.(4) The Term Loan Facility matures on May 29, 2025.(5) For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2023 revolving loans outstanding at March 31, 2019 will be paid on May 18, 2023, which is the maturity date of such borrowings.(6) For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2017 senior convertible debt will be paid on February 15, 2027, which is the maturity date of such debt.(7) For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2015 Senior Convertible Debt will be paid on February 15, 2025, which is the maturity date of such debt.(8) For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt will be paid on February 15, 2037, which is the maturity date of such debt.(9) For purposes of this table, pension obligations due in more than 5 years represent the expected pension payments from 2025 through 2029. It excludes pension obligations subsequent to 2029.(10) During fiscal 2018, we recognized a provisionary one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $644.7 million, as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform. As of December 31, 2018, with the conclusion of the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118, we increased this amount by $13.1 million to $657.8 million, of which we expect cash payments of approximately $280.7 million after offsets by the utilization of various tax attribute carryforwards in the United States. Our first payment on this obligation of $35.0 million was made in the quarter ended September 30, 2018 and we expect future cash payments of approximately $245.7 million. This tax is to be paid over a period of eight years, with 8% of the transition tax paid each year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid during fiscal 2024, 2025, and 2026.(11) The contractual obligations do not include amounts related to uncertain tax positions because reasonable estimates cannot be made.Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services, with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries, are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Reductions in inventory valuation are included in Cost of revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand, product lifecycle status and product development plans. The Company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reduce the inventory cost basis. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.

Excluding the impact of the surcharge revenue, our gross margin in fiscal year 2019 was 22.9 percent compared to 21.3 percent in fiscal year 2018. The results reflect the impact of improved product mix coupled with capacity gains and operating cost reductions compared to the same period a year ago. Fiscal year 2019 also reflects an $11.4 million benefit related to an insurance recovery in our third fiscal quarter.Our surcharge mechanism is structured to recover increases in raw material costs, although in certain cases with a lag effect as discussed above. While the surcharge generally protects the absolute gross profit dollars, it does have a dilutive effect on gross margin as a percent of sales. The following represents a summary of the dilutive impact of the surcharge on gross margin. We present and discuss these financial measures because management believes removing the impact of surcharge provides a more consistent and meaningful basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. See the section “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion of these financial measures.

(Golden Ridge). The primary activity of the business is the operation of a rice mill in Wynne, Arkansas. We acquired the business as part of our strategy to vertically integrate in order to leverage our proprietary technologies for producing SRB and derivative products. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of Golden Ridge’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning November 28, 2018. In 2018, we incurred $0.1 million of Golden Ridge acquisition-related costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.The purchase price for Golden Ridge was subject to adjustment if the estimated working capital with respect to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed at the time of closing was different than the actual closing working capital, as defined in the purchase agreement. We revised our preliminary estimate of the working capital adjustment as indicated in the table below. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation as of closing and as revised (in thousands, except share and per share amounts).The 1,666,667 shares issued at closing of our purchase of Golden Ridge included 380,952 shares that were deposited in an escrow account to be used to satisfy any indemnification obligations of the seller that may arise. As of December 31, 2018, the 380,952 shares remained in escrow. In July 2019, we reached an agreement to settle the $0.6 million working capital adjustment receivable and other claims with the sellers of Golden Ridge. As a result, (i) 340,000 shares of common stock held in the escrow account ($1.0 million fair value as of both the settlement date and the November 28, 2018, acquisition date) were returned to us and retired, (ii) the remaining $0.4 million note payable we owed to a seller was cancelled and (iii) certain open grain purchase contracts with entities related to a seller were terminated. We recorded a gain on the noncash settlement of $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, which is included in other income. In connection with the foregoing, a settlement agreement was entered into among the parties. All shares of common stock were distributed and the escrow agreement was terminated.

In addition, management’s incentive plans include these non-GAAP measures as criteria for achievements. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from non- GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies.

The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The non-GAAP results presented below exclude the impact of non-cash related charges, such as stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, they exclude discontinued operations and other nonrecurring items such as acquisition-related costs and restructuring expenses, as they are not indicative of future performance. The tax effect of our non-GAAP adjustments represents the anticipated annual tax rate applied to each non-GAAP adjustment after consideration of their respective book and tax treatments and effect of adoption of the Tax Act.

Social networks revenues increased by 17% to RMB85,281 million. The increase mainly reflected revenue growth from digital content services such as live broadcast services and video streaming subscriptions.Revenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 39% year-on-year to RMB101.4 billion. The increase was primarily driven by greater revenues from commercial payment due to increased daily active consumers and number of transactions per user. Greater revenues from cloud services also contributed to the annual growth.Revenues from Online Advertising business increased by 18% year-on-year to RMB68,377 million. Social and others advertising revenues grew by 33% to RMB52,897 million. The increase mainly reflected higher advertising revenues derived from Weixin (primarily Weixin Moments and Mini Programs) as a result of its increased inventories and impressions, as well as contributions from our mobile advertising network due to increased traffic and video inventories. Media advertising revenues decreased by 15% to RMB15,480 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising revenues from our media platforms including Tencent Video and Tencent News resulting from unpredictability in broadcast schedules and the challenging macro-environment, as well as the absence of the FIFA World Cup in year 2019.

Interest of zero, $217,000 and $1.1 million was capitalized for construction of certain facilities during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectivelyOn July 10, 2018, we entered into a $100.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a five-year term. The credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility includes an accordion feature permitting the Company, with the consent of the administrative agent, to increase the revolving commitments in the aggregate up to $125.0 million. No amounts were borrowed under the facility as of June 1, 2019 or during fiscal 2019. The Company had $3.7 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility at June 1, 2019.The interest rate is based, at the Company’s election, on either the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the
Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The “Eurodollar Rate” means the reserve adjusted rate at which Eurodollar
deposits in the London interbank market for an interest period of one, two, three, six or twelve months (as selected by
the Company) are quoted. The “Base Rate” means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the administrative agent, and (c) the Table of Contents 54 Eurodollar Rate for an interest period of one month plus 1% per annum, subject to certain interest rate floors. The “Applicable Margin” means 0.00% to 0.75% per annum for Base Rate Loans and 1.00% to 1.75% per annum for Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case depending upon the average outstanding balance at the quarterly pricing date. The Company will pay a commitment fee of 0.20% on the unused portion of the facility.The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by all the current and future wholly-owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and is secured by a first-priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the Company’s and the guarantors’ accounts, payment intangibles, instruments (including promissory notes), chattel paper, inventory (including farm products) and deposit accounts maintained with the administrative agent.The credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of liens, incurrence of additional debt, sales of assets and other fundamental corporate changes and investments. The credit agreement requires maintenance of two financial covenants (i) a minimum working capital ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 and (ii) an annual limit on capital expenditures of $100.0 million. Additionally, the credit agreement requires that Fred R. Adams Jr., his spouse, natural children, sons-in-law or grandchildren, or any trust, guardianship, conservatorship or custodianship for the primary benefit of any of the foregoing, or any family limited partnership, similar limited liability company or other entity that 100% of the voting control of such entity is held by any of the foregoing, shall maintain at least 50% of the Company’s voting stock. Failure to satisfy any of these covenants will constitute a default under the terms of the credit agreement. Further, dividends are restricted to the Company’s current dividend policy of one-third of the Company’s net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company is allowed to repurchase up to $75.0 million of its capital stock in any year provided there is no default under the credit agreement and the Company has availability of at least $20.0 million under the facility.The credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility also includes customary events of default and customary remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default, including acceleration of the amounts due and foreclosure of the collateral.At June 1, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of all loan agreements.

Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 2%. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.The volume of channel partner financing was $29.6 billion, $28.2 billion, and $27.0 billion in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 27, 2019, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $218 million, of which approximately $77 million was recorded as deferred revenue.

Short-term variable benchmark interest rates during these periods were generally less than 3.0% and, as such, we incurred realized losses of $8.3 million and $13.9 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, under the interest rate swap agreements.We did not incur any realized losses related to the termination of interest rate swaps in 2019, compared to realized losses of $13.7 million during 2018. Primarily as a result of significant changes in long-term benchmark interest rates during 2019 and 2018, we recognized unrealized losses of $7.9 million in 2019 compared to unrealized gains of $33.7 million in 2018 under the interest rate swap agreements.During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a reversal of previously unrealized losses of $26.9 million on all the warrants held by Teekay to purchase common units of Altera (or the Warrants) as a result of the sale of the Warrants to Brookfield, and we concurrently recognized a realized loss of $25.6 million during the same period. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized unrealized losses of $21.1 million on the Warrants. Please read “Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 12 – Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments.”Foreign Exchange Loss. Foreign currency exchange losses were $13.6 million in 2019 compared to gains of $6.1 million in 2018. Our foreign currency exchange gains and losses, substantially all of which are unrealized, are primarily due to the relevant period-end revaluation of our Norwegian-Krone (or NOK)-denominated debt and our Euro-denominated term loans, finance leases and restricted cash for financial reporting purposes and the realized and unrealized (losses) gains on our cross currency swaps.Gains on NOK-denominated and Euro-denominated monetary liabilities reflect a stronger U.S. Dollar against the NOK and Euro on the date of revaluation or settlement compared to the rate in effect at the beginning of the period. Losses on NOK-denominated and Euro-denominated monetary liabilities reflect a weaker U.S. Dollar against the NOK and Euro on the date of revaluation or settlement compared to the rate in effect at the beginning of the period.For 2019, foreign currency exchange loss included realized losses of $5.1 million (2018 – $6.5 million) and unrealized losses of $13.2 million (2018 – gains of $21.2 million) on our cross currency swaps, realized losses on maturity and termination of cross currency swaps of $nil (2018 – $42.3 million) and unrealized gains of $5.8 million (2018 – gains of $19.2 million) on the revaluation of our NOK-denominated debt.Loss on deconsolidation of Altera. Loss on deconsolidation of Altera was $7.1 million in 2018. Please read ""Item 18 – Financial Statements: Note 4 – Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera.""Other loss. Other loss was $14.5 million in 2019 compared to $2.0 million in 2018. Other loss in 2019 was primarily due to losses of $10.6 million on the repurchase of 2020 Notes, $2.0 million tax expense on Teekay LNG's income from U.S. sources and $1.4 million losses relating to Teekay LNG's sale lease-back refinancing of the Torben Spirit completed in 2019. Other loss in 2018 included $1.8 million related to repurchases of the 2020 Notes and $0.6 million related to the tax indemnification guarantee liability related to the Teekay Nakilat finance lease.Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $25.5 million in 2019 compared to $19.7 million in 2018. This increase in income tax expense was primarily due to changes to freight tax accruals in 2019.

The constant currency decrease in our services revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was attributable to declines in our consulting and education services revenues.

Changes in working capital, reflected within cash flow from operations, benefited from:• our continued focus on improving trade receivables collection; • a reduction in inventory levels due to a high level of shipments at the end of 2019; and • growth in payables, resulting from the increase in activity levels and emphasis on extending supplier payment terms.Free cash flow for 2019 almost doubled year-on-year coming in at $100.1 million, compared to $50.9 million in 2018, resulting in a free cash flow conversion which represented 123 per cent of adjusted earnings (2018 77 per cent).Free cash flow is set out below:Note1. Spirent adopted IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019; in prior periods operating lease payments were included within cash flow from operations.Free cash flow includes a net cash outflow in respect of exceptional items in 2018 and 2019 of $5.5 million (2018 $3.6 million in respect of exceptional items charged in 2017 and 2018).Tax payments of $5.6 million made in 2019 were consistent with the prior year (2018 $5.7 million). Net capital expenditure of $11.9 million was also broadly consistent with the prior year (2018 $10.6 million), with the incremental spend of $1.3 million primarily related to investment in 5G. We continue to exercise careful management of capital investment to ensure efficient use of capital and maximise return on investment.Following the adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, the payment of lease liabilities, both the principal and interest elements, are shown separately from net cash flow from operating activities. In previous periods they would have been reflected in that number. There is no overall impact in comparing free cash flow year-on-year.In 2019, the final dividend for 2018 and an interim dividend for 2019 totalling $28.6 million were paid. This compared to total dividends of $54.8 million paid in 2018, including a special dividend of $29.9 million. In addition, 4.0 million shares were purchased and placed into the Employee Share Ownership Trust at a cost of $8.6 million (2018 1.5 million shares at a net cost of $2.5 million) and $1.9 million of cash consideration was paid to acquire the business of a navigation systems company based in the United Kingdom.Following these payments, cash and cash equivalents closed at $183.2 million at 31 December 2019, compared with $121.6 million at 31 December 2018.

For contracts that include renewal provisions, revenue is recognized up-front upon satisfaction of the associated performance obligations, but payments are received upon renewal. Renewals occur in bi-annual and annual increments over the associated expected contract term, the majority of which range from two to five years. The Company’s contracts with customers under multi-year arrangements generally have three-year terms and are invoiced annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. The Company records a receivable related to revenue recognized under multi-year arrangements as the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to these arrangements.Where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing and payment, the Company has determined that its contracts do not include a significant financing component. A substantial amount of the consideration promised by the customer under the contracts that include renewal provisions is variable, and the amount and timing of that consideration varies based on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events that are not substantially within the Company’s control. With respect to multi-year year arrangements, there is minimal difference between the consideration received and the cash selling price, any offered discounts are driven by volume, and the contracts are of short duration resulting in insignificant interest. Thus, the primary purpose of the invoicing terms on the multi-year arrangements is to provide the customer with a simplified and predictable way of purchasing certain products, not to provide financing or to receive financing from the Company’s customer.

We use these non- GAAP measures to assess performance against business objectives, make business decisions, including developing budgets and forecasting future periods. In addition, management’s incentive plans include these non-GAAP measures as criteria for achievements. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from non- GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. However, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information that enables readers to evaluate our business from the perspective of management. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The non-GAAP results presented below exclude the impact of non-cash related charges, such as stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, they exclude discontinued operations and other nonrecurring items such as acquisition-related costs and restructuring expenses, as they are not indicative of future performance. The tax effect of our non-GAAP adjustments represents the anticipated annual tax rate applied to each non-GAAP adjustment after consideration of their respective book and tax treatments and effect of adoption of the Tax Act.
